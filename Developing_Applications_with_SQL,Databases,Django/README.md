# Developing Applications with SQL, Databases, and Django
by IBM

## About this Course
The essentials of application development are accessing, processing, and presenting data. Data is stored in various databases, either on-premise or on the cloud, and developers will need to learn how to talk to them via programming languages.

In this course, you will be introduced to some fundamental database concepts. You will learn the basics of SQL, a simple and powerful programming language for querying and managing data. And you will learn about cloud database fundamentals and get hands-on cloud database experiences.  

In addition to SQL, you will discover how Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows you to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages to work with databases. You will gain full-stack Django skills by creating a Django web app to persist, process, and present data. And you will learn about cloud app platform fundamentals and get hands-on experience deploying your Django web app on the cloud.

Course Learning Objectives: 
- Describe what is a database and how to model data
- Compose SQL queries to insert, select, update, delete data in a database
- Understand Object Relational Model (ORM)
- Employ Django to develop database-powered applications
- Deploy your Django app on the cloud

Prerequisites:
- GitHub
- HTML & CSS 
- Python

## Week One: Getting Started with SQL & Relational Databases
What is data? As you start this course, you will be introduced to some concepts that are fundamental to understanding data, databases, and database management systems. 
  
You will learn some basic SQL statements. 
  
Explore the structure, use cases, and limitations of relational databases. 
  
Learn key relational database concepts, including entities, attributes, entity-relationship data modeling, common data types, and primary key.

## Week Two: ORM: Bridging the Gap Between the Real World and Relational Model
Youâ€™re aware that SQL is a powerful tool for working with databases. But in the modern application development environment, object-oriented programming is the most popular paradigm, and it is quite different from SQL. Is there a way to use Object-oriented programming to work with databases?

Discover how Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) bridges the gap between object-oriented programming (OOP) and SQL and allows application developers to use OOP languages to work with databases without writing SQL code. Gain skills in using Django ORM, a popular ORM library for Python, to define models and fields so they can be mapped to database tables. Learn the steps for using Django ORM to convert your entity-relationship diagrams into Django models. Gain knowledge about using Django Model APIs to manipulate objects in databases without writing SQL queries. Explore the many useful methods Django Model provides to handle related objects.
