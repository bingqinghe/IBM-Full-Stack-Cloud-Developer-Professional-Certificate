# Python Project for AI & Application Development
by IBM

## About this Course
This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to develop applications and AI powered solutions. 

Assume the role of a developer and unit test and package an application with the help of multiple hands-on labs. 

After completing this course you will have acquired the confidence to begin developing AI enabled applications using Python, build and run unit tests, and package the application for distribution.

## Week One: [Python - Unit testing, module packaging and web application development](./Week_One)
In this module, you will be introduced to the process of packaging, unit testing in Python and Flask, a microweb framework, the creation of web applications using flask. 

Packaging allows the Cloud Application Developer to produce a coding unit that can be tested and integrated into a codebase. 

Unit testing assures that code is error-free and integrates properly within a larger project. 

Flask is an open-source python package that allows you to create web applications.

## Week Two: Final Assignment - Python Web Application
Demonstrate how to unit test Python code

Demonstrate how to create a Python Package

Demonstrate how to create a Python Web Application
