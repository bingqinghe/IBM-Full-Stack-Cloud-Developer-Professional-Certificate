# Developing Cloud Native Applications
by IBM

## About this Course
Do you want to learn about developing applications that are cloud native right from conception to implementation? 

In this course, you’ll begin with some crucial cloud concepts. 

Then, you will dive into specific tools and techniques for developing cloud native apps. 

Learning about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the significance of hybrid cloud infrastructures, and how they affect cloud app developers will be covered You will then look at two key areas of cloud thinking: modernization and continuous integration/continuous delivery.

## Week Five: REST Architecture and Watson API
What is Representational State Transfer (REST)? 

Discover how you can use REST to retrieve, update, and delete web resources. 

Explore how to use RESTful services as entry points to cloud server applications. 

Find out how JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) provides a minimal, portable, textual data interchange format for server-side applications. 

See how you can use IBM Cloud Watson application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed as REST APIs to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data. 

Learn how to use an API client to construct requests and read responses.

## Week Six: Introduction to Data Services in IBM Cloud
Cloud computing skills, and especially database knowledge, are in demand. 

In this module, learn how IBM Cloud supports both NoSQL and SQL database services. 

Discover how IBM Cloudant’s NoSQL high-performing database capabilities enable developers to focus on value-enhancing business development. 

Then, gain the knowledge you need to quickly create, locate, configure, and manage a Cloudant database.

## Week Seven: Final Project
You now have the skills necessary to create and modify applications, connect cloud services, and configure CI/CD. 

You’re ready to take on the challenge of building your own IBM Cloudant connected, CI/CD enabled application.
