What do developers rely on to extend Node.js features?  JavaScript  Timely updates* External libraries and packages  JSON2. Node.js doesn't provide a parsing function for which language?  JavaScript   JSON * XML   HTML 3. One disadvantage of manual parsing is that string matching ignores the XML data structure. However, depending on XML data complexity, string matching might be more efficient than what?  An XML root element  No alternative: string matching is never more efficient.  An XML attribute structure* An XML tree of the data4. Which Node.js package can parse a string of XML elements into a JavaScript object?  Async.js* xml2js  XML-JS  Expressjs5.

In contrast, Express implements an app class for what purpose?  Look up web services* Map to a web resource path  Access a URL  Parse through a network path7. Which function relies on custom callback functions to parse across web resource path?  ReadableStream   createServer()* http.createServer  http.IncomingMessage 8. After creating the new route handler to handle web application requests, what occurs next?  Access a variable in the path* Listen to incoming HTTP GET requests  Store values in a location variable  Pass the parameter location9. What do you call to create a web server object to listen for incoming requests on a port?  http.view  app.request* app.listen  http.name10.
